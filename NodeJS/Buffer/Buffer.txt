What is a Buffer ?

Buffer is area of memory
Here data is stored in the form of array of integers.
This data is present/memory is allocated outside the V8 Heap.
Node.js has a Buffer class which is global and need not be imported it can be used to store our data in array of integers.

Different functions:
1)Buffer.alloc()
2)Buffer.from()
3)Buffer1.compare(Buffer2);
4)Buffer.concat([list],totallength)
5)Buffer.toString()
6)Buffer1.copy(Buffer2)

What is a stream?

Stream helps us to process our data in chunks rather than processing at once(in case of a large file).
Streams provide time and memory efficiency
Types of streams:
1)Readable
2)Writeable
3)Transform
4)Duplex

Certain Event Emitters

1)data - triggered when data is ready to be read/write
2)end - when there is no data left to be processed
3)finish - when a process is over
4)error - when an error occurs
