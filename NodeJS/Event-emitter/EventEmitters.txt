Node JS is a single threaded application.
To mainatin concurrency it uses events and callbacks.
Node JS has async functions that use async callbacks.
Instead of waiting for the response from the server the requests are present in the event queue.
As soon as we receive the response an event is triggered and a handler is called.

The functions that listen to events are called as observers.
.on()
.emit()
