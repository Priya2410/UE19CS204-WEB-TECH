Stateful components maintain state
Constructor in React :
-> Used to initialize the object state
-> Automatically called during object creation
Constructor(props)
{
    super(props);
}
If you dont call super(props) it leads to undefined properties.
Whenever we use a constructor we have to always call super(props).

Constructors are used to initialize the local state of the component using this.state
This is used to bind the event handler methods 
this.state is used to set an state
and setState() to change the state.

React has an in built state object 
This state object is used to hold the property values of a component
Whenever the state of the object changes the component re renders --- ex Gmail
The state is initialized in the constructor
