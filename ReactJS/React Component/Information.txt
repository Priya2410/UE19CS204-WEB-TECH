Components in React JS
Part of the UI 
Example header,footer,sidenav,navbar,main content
All components come together to make the app.
The components are reusable.

Component in code placed in JS file like app.js or app.jsx 
Component types :
1) class components have a render method 
2) function components

Independent and reusable pieces of code.
Class Component :
1) Start with upper case 
2) has to include extends React.Component
3) Use the render() method to return html 

The components can have properties.
props helps you to fetch the properties from the given input 

Whenever you give JS content in the render method we use {}
