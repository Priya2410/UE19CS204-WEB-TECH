What is React JS ?
Front end library for client side development.
ReactJS is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building reusable UI components.
It is an open-source, component-based front end library responsible only for the view layer of the application.

Build up complex interfaces through
->simple Components,
->connect them to data on your backend server, and
->render them as HTML

Strengths include
handling stateful, data-driven interfaces
great support for forms, error handling, events, lists, etc.

Disadvantages of Single Page Applications :
->In a single page application, the bulk of your time will be spent keeping  your data in-sync with your UI
->Manipulating the DOM is really slow
->Working with HTML templates can be a pain

REACT:
A ReactJS application is made up of multiple components, each component responsible for outputting a small, reusable piece of HTML code.
The components are the heart of all React applications.
These Components can be nested with other components to allow complex applications to be built of simple building blocks.
ReactJS uses virtual DOM based mechanism to fill data in HTML DOM.
The virtual DOM works fast as it only changes individual DOM elements instead of reloading complete DOM every time.


Advantages:
Automatic UI State Management
Lightning-fast DOM Manipulation
APIs to Create Component based UIs
Visuals Defined Entirely in JavaScript

What is JSX?
JSX stands for JavaScript XML.
JSX allows us to write HTML in React.
JSX makes it easier to write and add HTML in React.
JSX allows us to write HTML elements in JavaScript and place them in the DOM without any createElement()  and/or appendChild() methods.
JSX converts HTML tags into react element
