React doesnt render duplicate keys
Example :
const arr=[1,2,3,4,2];
<ul>
    arr.map((num)=><li key={num}>{num}</li>);
</ul>
This gives a warning that two of the keys are same
We cant have duplicate keys 
The output is 
<ul>
<li>1</li>
<li>2</li>
<li>3</li>
<li>4</li>
</ul>

Key is a unique indentifier.

Example 2:
var users=[{username:'bob'},{username:'sue'}] // Array of objects
users.map((u,i)=><div key={i}>{u.username}</div>)
//
<div key="1">bob</div>
<div key="2">sue</div>

So here we add an element before bob
like
var users=[{username:'joe'},{username:'bob'},{username:'sue'}]
So here 3 changes will take place according to react 
bob->joe
sue->bob
new element sue is added

Instead of this its better to have keys with "usernames" makes it less complex for react

Here u is the object reference and i is the index so we are mapping users with key as index;
