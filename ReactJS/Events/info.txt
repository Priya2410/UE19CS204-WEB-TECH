React events are similar to JS 
All events are written in camel case syntax
onClick
React Event handlers are in the brackets 
onClick={func};
(like for JS onclick="func()")

Synthetic events - has additional information 
Wrapper around the DOMEventObject
No addEventListener method
event.preventDefault() to prevent the default behaviour of the preventDefault
event.stopPropagation() to stop bubbling and capture phases

Event Pooling 
Synthetic Event Object is reused
Basically after the event is used then all the properties are nullified
To stop this nullification you can stop it by event.persist

Focus,blur dont bubble
