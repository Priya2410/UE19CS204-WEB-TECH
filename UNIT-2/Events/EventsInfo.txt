Events
can be clicking on a element,listening to the key
To work with events we need to 
1)Listen to the event
2)React to the event

.addEventListener //Listens to the function //Notify the applications that event has triggered
.addEventListener('click',callback)

Listening to events can be done in three ways
1)Inline events onclick,ondblclick,onkeydown,onkeyup
2)Traditional events
3)W3C Model addEventListener

Events 
click
dblclick
mouseover
mouseout
mousedown
event.shiftKey is true if its pressed else false
event.altKey
event.clientX 
event.clientY where X and Y are coordinates of the mouse pointer

Keyboard Events
keydown 
keyup
event.keyCode to know which key was pressed 

onfocus 
onblur
like on input type if we click on it you get onfocus else onblur
