What is asyncronous operation in JS ?

Synchronous JS is step by step execution 
While asyncronous is used when we want to fetch data from some source like database 
Synchronous - If there is a error in one step it doesnt proceed further 
In asynchronous it doesnt wait for one step to execute the other so we use asynchronous

What is a callback function ?

A function which executes after other function is executed.
In JS functions are objects.
Any function in JS that take function as a argument are called Higher Order Function.
This callback function needs to wait till the other function is executed.
Ex div.addEventListener("event",function())
This function is called asynchronous

Promise
Used to handle async result of the operation.
With promise we can defer execution of a code block till the async request is completed.

Promise object is created using new keyword 
It has two callbacks resolve and reject
const promise = new Promise(function(resolve,reject){});

A promise status can be :
1)fulfilled  promise is a success
2)rejected   promise failed
3)pending     not executed 
4)settled   either success or failed

.catch(onRejected)  //When there a error 
.then(onFulfilled,onRejected) //When it is fulfilled
.finally(onFinally) //Executed anyways 


Callbacks and Promises	are not the same
Callbacks are function passed to another function as a  reference
Chaining of Callbacks can be clumsy and lead to Callback Hell
Promises use Callbacks and more elegant than Callbacks
Chaining of Promises is supported
