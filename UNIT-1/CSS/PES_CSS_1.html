 were his words. People avoided him, because his misfortune became <br/>contagious.

 <h2 class="center", id="p2">"An Old Man is happy today, he doesn’t <br/>

<blockquote class="abc">“Nothing special. Eighty years I’ve been chasing happiness, 
and it was useless. <br/>And then I decided to live without 
happiness and just enjoy life. That’s why I’m happy now.” – An Old Man
