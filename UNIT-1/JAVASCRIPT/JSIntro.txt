Client Side Scripting Language
Browser can directly show the ouput not necessary to have a server to process the code
Pros:
Allows dynamic HTML pages
Complete web pages
Browser can respond more rapidly to user events

Cons:
Requires a JS Enabled Browser
What works one on one browser may generate an error on the other
Can cause security problems.

Use the <script> tag for embedding JS in HTML
<script type='text/javascript'>

The script must be placed in the head sometimes or sometimes in the body.

HTML used to define the content of the webpage
CSS used to define the layout of the webpage
JS used to make the web pages dynamic

Client->Request->Server->Response

The server will give the page to the browser it doesnt process it
The browser will process the web page and the output is shown on the browser
The processing happens at the client Side hence client side Scripting
