<!-- JS is a loosely and dynamically typed language
1. typeof operator gives the type of a variable
2. copying a variable is valid; ex: var age=50; var limit=age;
3. Declaring twice triggers an error
4. Case matters
5. To declare a constant (unchanging) variable, use const instead of let/var:
-->

<body>
    <script>
    let message = 'Hello!'; // define the variable and assign the value
    alert(message); // Hello! in an alert box //Displays output in alert box

    let user = 'John', age = 25, mess="helloclass"; //multiple variables in one line is valid;
    document.write(user+" age is "+age+" and says "+mess);
    
    let $ = 5; // declared a variable with the name "$"
    let _ = 2; // and now a variable with the name "_"
    alert($ + _); // 
    </script>
</body>
